# React + TypeScript + Vite + Comet Design System Demo

This project demonstrates the implementation and usage of the Comet Design System components library in a React application. It serves two main purposes:

1. Testing the Comet Design System library locally using the .tgz package
2. Showcasing different implementation approaches for Comet components:
   - Wrapping Comet components in React components (demonstrated in the homepage dashboard)
   - Direct usage of Comet components (shown in the support page form)
